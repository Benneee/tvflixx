# TVFlixx

## Project Background
Before now, I've done a few movie-type of web-apps, (simple) applications showing a list of movies from an API and their details.

[Moflixx](https://github.com/Benneee/moflixx) comes to mind.

I'm currently (trying to) work(ing) more with TypeScript and Vue 3 (Composition API), I felt a better way to do stuff with TV shows would be "TVFlixx.

I'm a huge TV shows fan so this was interesting to me at first glance, without thinking too much about the effort required.

I found an API that really works and started drawing plans and doing ToDos off the plans I had drawn.

## Thought Process


Like [Moflixx](https://github.com/Benneee/moflixx), I needed an API for the TV shows and their details, that's where [Episodate](https://www.episodate.com/) comes in.

Next, I needed to draw up a structure for the application, I needed a few pages, components and probably widgets:

I always like a "favorites" feature in applications like this, so I couldn't resist the temptation.

*Sidenote: I should probably create something off my obsession for favorites feature*
